#lilybot

The goal of lilybot is to provide an easy to use cloud based software system for hobby/ametuer robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. This is primarily focused on the Raspberry Pi. This repo contains samples, demos, and libraries to do things like reading sensor data, control motors, and handling realt-time networking with other lilybots over the Internet.  

The software components of lilybot consist of three main functions.

1. The Raspberry Pi client
  This application runs on the Raspberry Pi and automatically connects to the web server ardyh. Over this connection it can stream data and listen and responds to commands from other lilybots. Use `rpi_client/settings.py` what hardware is attached to the Raspberry and set other settings. Once running you can view the webpage at RASPBERRY_PI_IPADDRESS:9093.

2. The ~ardyh~ real-time socket web server
  This server attacks as a pub/sub server for lilybot clients. The rpi_client will automatically try to establish a web socket connection to a server running this application at `ws://173.255.213.55:9093/ws`. You can use this server or run your own instance.
  See a demo here http://ardyh.solalla.com


3. Web application clients. 


## 1. Hardware Packages

To configure a hardware package you need to edit `rpi_client/local_settings.py`


### JJbot
A Libaray to control Lego Mindsorm sensors and motors (EV3 Sensors 
are not currenlt supported by brick BrickPi, but EV3 motors do work fine) connected to a BrickPi.

# Getting Started

## 1. Install the Raspbian Operating System
If you already have a Raspberry Pi up and running you can skip to step 2. It is best to start with a freshly installed version of Rasbian.

Set up a new Raspberry Pi model B with the Raspbian distribution. I followed the instructions here http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/. The guide has you install NOOBS. NOOBS is a startup program that let's you install different OS's on the Raspberry Pi. In this repo I use the Raspbian version unless otherwise noted (JJBOT uses a different version).  You will need an 8GB or bigger SD card to install Raspbian. 

Once you have NOOBS installed on the SD Card, connect the wi-fi dongle, enthernet cable, (monitor and keyboard if you have one) and finally boot up by connecting the power.

On first boot select the Raspbian operating system and click "i". This will takes a while. On successfult install the Rpi will reboot and you will find yourself at the rasp-conf screen. 

### Related Links

* NOOBS Download (Use NOOBS Lite if you have a ethernet network connection to the pi) `http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/`

* SD Formatter 4.0 - https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/

<div id="step2"></div>


----
## 2. Raspberry Pi Configuration with rasp-config
At this point you should have a fresh version of Rasbian installed and you should either be directly connected to the raspberry Pi or have access over SSH on an ethernet cable. We will configure Wi-Fi in the next step. 

* Open the raspi-config menu. From the terminal type `rasp-config` on the command line. 

* Change option 3 to boot to console. Choose option 3 and select "Console Text console, requiring login (default)"

* Under *Advanced Options* change the hostname to something more descriptive and unique. This is more import when running multiple RPi's. I use rpi1, rpi2, etc...

* Under *Advanced Options* enable the SPI kernal. This is used for ????

* Enable Camera

If you are not from the UK you may want to change the country code of the Raspberry Pi at this time. If so select *Finish* but **do not reboot** then follow the instruction below. If you do not want to change the country code, simply Finish and reboot.

* **(Optional) Keyboard Country Code** - By default the Raspberry py will be set with a keyboard country code of "gb" for Great Britian. You should change this to your country code. For me in the US of A its "us".

  To change this edit the `/etc/default/keyboard` file. Change the line to the appropriate country code.
    ```
    XKBLAYOUT=”us”

    ```


**Troubleshooting**

You may get the follwoing error when connecting to the Raspberry Pi over WiFi if you have already connected over ethernet. 

```

```

To fix this, on the machine you are ssh'ing from (i.e. not the rPi) edit the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and remove the line whihc points at you Raspberry Pi's IP address.


----
## 3. Install and Update Software

Download and run the installer script. Grab some coffee this takes awhile. This will make a directory `/home/pi/projects/` and put the github repos in there. 

```
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilblack/lilybot/master/installer.sh)
```


## 4. Configure the rpi_client with the bot package you are using

* Copy a local setting file from `rpi_client/bot_roles/` into rpi_client/local_settings.py. Edit that file appropriately.

TODO Show Example.

This is an example local_settings.py file. It is the bare minimum required.

```
settings= {
    "bot_name":"rp4.solalla.ardyh",
    "bot_roles":"bot",
    "bot_packages":[],
    "subscriptions":[],

}
```

## 5. (Optional) Set the Raspberry Pi to reconnect if it looses connection to ardyh
Add the following line to `/etc/crontab`

```
*    * * *   root    /home/pi/projects/lilybot/rpi_client/restart.sh > /home/pi/restart.log
```

###GrovePi Troubleshooting

*On Grovebot the PIR sensor does not work.*
If you are having trouble with the SMBus (for the light sensor on Grovebot for instance) you can user `i2cdetect` to debug.

```
# Query for the device. You may need to check 0 also. 
sudo i2cdetect 1
```

You should get something that looks like below, if you don't, try a different device number.


```
pi@rpi2 ~ $ sudo i2cdetect 1
WARNING! This program can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss and worse!
I will probe file /dev/i2c-1.
I will probe address range 0x03-0x77.
Continue? [Y/n] Y
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

```

Then run the following

```
# Not sure what this does.
sudo modprobe i2c-bcm2708
sudo modprobe i2c-dev
lsmod

# Then reboot
sudo shutdown -r now
```


If you are installing a grovebot and get the following error then just reboot the Raspberry Pi manually `sudo shutdown -r now`.

```
All Done.
Check and reboot now to apply changes.

shutdown: you must be root to do that!
```



### Links 
I2C documentation. The Raspberry Pi talks to the GrovePi using the SMBus and I2c.
http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/i2cToolsDocumentation

## 4. Attach hardware and reboot.

After all that is done we are finally ready to attach the bot package specific hardware and a Wi-Fi dongle. Omce you attach the appropraite hardware and Wi-Fi dongle reboot the Raspberry Pi (`sudo shutdown -r now`). Once rebotted the Raspberry Pi will look for a Wi-Fi network named *ardyhnet* with passkey *ardyhnet*. To change this you can edit `/etc/network/interfaces`.

## 6. Install Camera and Camera Software (Optional)




#### Method 1 - Streaming with mjpg-streamer (only works on your local network)

Here is a video showinghow to connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi http://youtu.be/GImeVqHQzsE 

Follow the instruction here http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi to install the software on the RPi. They are summarized below

**NOTE** First make sure the camera is enabled. Run `sudo raspi-config` and enable the camera.

1. Install software packages. 
	```sh
	cd ~/
	sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev imagemagick libv4l-dev
	sudo ln -s /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h /usr/include/linux/videodev.h
	
	```
2. Then make a temp directory to download the MJPEG-Streamer zip file

	```sh
	mkdir ~/temp
	cd ~/temp
	wget http://sourceforge.net/code-snapshots/svn/m/mj/mjpg-streamer/code/mjpg-streamer-code-182.zip
	unzip mjpg-streamer-code-182.zip
	cd mjpg-streamer-code-182/mjpg-streamer
	make mjpg_streamer input_file.so output_http.so
	
	sudo cp mjpg_streamer /usr/local/bin
	sudo cp output_http.so input_file.so /usr/local/lib/

	cp -R www ~/projects/lilybot/rpi_client/camera_stream/  # This is what I did but I don't think its right.
	
	```

3. Now we should be able to  start the camera. The code below will start 
the camera and a webserver on port 8080 that will stream the video. 
To see run the code and open a browser and point it at `http://RASPBERRYPI_IP:8080`

	```sh
	mkdir /tmp/stream
	raspistill --nopreview -w 640 -h 480 -q 5 -o /tmp/stream/pic.jpg -tl 100 -t 9999999 -th 0:0:0
	
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib mjpg_streamer -i "input_file.so -f /tmp/stream -n pic.jpg" -o "output_http.so -w /home/pi/Projects/lilybot/jjbot/www"

	```

#### Method 2 - Websockets streaming with ffmpeg


1. On the Raspberry Pi Build and configure [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) on the Rapsberry Pi. It takes a while. I followed the instructions [here](http://sirlagz.net/2012/08/04/how-to-stream-a-webcam-from-the-raspberry-pi/). It takes a while. Below are the steps from that link.
 
  0. Make sure the camera is enabled on the Pi.
  
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo raspi-config
  # Then follow the menu to enable the camera.
  ```

  1. Clone the repo and and build the binaries.
    
   ```
   cd /usr/src/
   git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
   sudo chown -R pi:users ffmpeg
   cd ffmpeg
   ./configure    # This takes a minute or so. 
   make           # This takes about 3+ hours
   make install
   ```

  To test this run 
  `raspivid -t 5000 -w 960 -h 540 -fps 25 -b 500000 -vf -o - | /usr/src/ffmpeg/ffmpeg -i - -vcodec copy -an -r 25 -f flv test.flv`. 
  
  NOTE: Still need to add `ffmpeg` to the path.
  
2. On the socket server install the stream-server.js script from https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg
	
    ```
    npm install ws
    node stream-server.js yourpassword
    ```

3. Then on the Raspberry Pi start the camera. You will need to change `<server-domain>` to the appropriate streaming server. 
  

  ```sh
  # This command is necessary to start the Raspberry Pi camera
  raspivid -t 5000 -w 960 -h 540 -fps 25 -b 500000 -vf -o - | /usr/src/ffmpeg/ffmpeg -i - -vcodec copy -an -r 25 -f flv test.flv

  # This starts the camera in the appropriate mode for streaming
  uv4l --driver raspicam --auto-video_nr --extension-presence=1

  # This command actually starts ffmpeg which encodes the video to mpeg1 format and streams the output to a streaming server.
  ffmpeg -s 320x240 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -f mpeg1video -b 800k -r 30 http://<server-domina>:8082/password/320/240/

  ```
  


  ### Troubleshooting.
  I got this error 
  
	```
	[video4linux2,v4l2 @ 0x1f6e450] Cannot open video device /dev/video0: No such file or directory /dev/video0: No such file or directory
	```
	
	Trying this to resolve it by installing [uv4l and uvl4l-raspicam](http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=14). Be sure and install the uv4l-raspicam-extras
	
	After that I got the follwoing error
	```
	[video4linux2,v4l2 @ 0x1b07450] The device does not support the streaming I/O method. 
	/dev/video0: Function not implemented
	```
	
	So this fixed that, see [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=50639)
	```
	uv4l --driver raspicam --auto-video_nr --extension-presence=1
	```
	
	But now I get this output
	```
	ffmpeg version N-68269-g74080de Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers

	[video4linux2,v4l2 @ 0x2c91450] mmap: No such device
	/dev/video1: No such device
	```
	
	A reboot seems to fix that, but I had to run `uv4l --driver raspicam --auto-video_nr --extension-presence=1` on reboot.
	Now I am getting
	
	```
	
	```

4. To view the stream, get the `stream-example.html` and `jsmpg.js` from the [jsmpeg](https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg) project. Change the WebSocket URL in the `stream-example.html` to the one of your server and open it in your favorite browser.

##### Troubleshooting

I got the below error. It looks like it is just some man page stuff. 
```

```

Then I got this error `Cannot open video device /dev/video0: No such file or directory`. Checking config.log It looks like there were build errors. Almost like it was not configured from the Raspberry pi. So after searching the internet I found a [part 3](http://sirlagz.net/2013/01/07/how-to-stream-a-webcam-from-the-raspberry-pi-part-3/) to the orignal tutorial. In it it said there maybe some errors to the original source so use the github repo instead.

```
git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
./configure
make && make install

```

*ffmpeg*
You can install `v4l2-ctl` to help troubleshoot with 
```
apt-get install v4l-utils v4l-conf
```

Could not get anything on /dev/video0/ even after running modprobe so I tried installing uv4l and uv4l-raspicam as per here http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=14. But got the following error:

```

.
.
.
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of uv4l-raspicam:

```

If you try to start the camera service with `start_server_camera.sh` and get the following error.

```sh

The command that is failing is the `raspistill`.

#### Troubleshooting

# For Developers

## The Ardyh Client 

### Starting and Stoppping.
The ardyh client is ran as a a service command with the name ardyh_clientd. It can be controlled using `/etc/init.d/ardyh_clientd`. By default the installer script will registers this service to start on boot. For debugging you may not want this. To turn it off use
```
# Turn off start on boot for ardyh_cleintd
sudo update-rc.d -f ardyh_clientd remove
```

To view the current running ardyh_clientd use 
```
ps aux | grep ardyh_clientd
```

To view all threads where <PID> is gotten from the above command.
```
ps -e -T | grep <PID>
```


The ardyh client will start two applications. The first application is a web server running on port 9010 to set local settings for the bot. It is available at <IP_ADDRESS>:9010. 

The second is a websocket client that is confugred to connect to the ardyh server at `ws://173.255.213.55:9093/ws`

### Manually start rpi_client
```
cd rpi_clinet
./start_ardyh_client.sh
```


### Set up client to start on boot (Depracted, the installer.sh script does this now)
First edit `rpi_client/ardyh_clientd` so that `DAEMON_PATH` points at the rpi_client/ directory.

```
DAEMON_PATH="/home/pi/projects/lilybot/rpi_client" 
```


Copy `lilybotd` and `lilybot_camerad` to the `etc/init.d` and update the rc.d file.


```
sudo cp rpi_client/ardyh_clientd /etc/init.d/.
sudo cp rpi_client/lilybotd_camera /etc/init.d/.

sudo update-rc.d ardyh_clientd defaults
sudo update-rc.d lilybot_camerad defaults
```


You may need to do a `chmod 775` to make these executable. You can then start and staop the deamon with `sudo /etc/init.d/ardyh_cleint start`


Once the deamon starts it ties up the port. You can see what ports are currently being used with

```
sudo netstat -lptu
sudo netstat -tulpn
```

## Adding SSH Key to GitHub

See [Generating SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) for more info.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add the public key to GtiHub Settings-->Deploy keys

# test with
ssh -T git@github.com
```


## A2. Adding passwordless login with authorized_keys on Rapsberry Pi

See http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md

Copy local key to the Raspberry Pi


From your regular computer run (you may need to create .ssh/authorized_keys in the Pi first)
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <USERNAME>@<IP-ADDRESS> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

```

## A3. Wi-Fi Dongles and Configuring Wi-Fi

I use these wi-fi dongles by Gymle based on the Realtek RTL8192 chipset.  
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HYHZJY/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 becuase they support wi-fi direct (see this guide http://dishingtech.blogspot.com/2012/01/realtek-wi-fi-direct-programming-guide.html). I have not tested wi-fi direct yet but have plans to in the future. 

Check here for a list of compatible wi-fi dongles http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters

In the terminal see if your wi-fi dongle is detected with ifconfig.
```
sudo ifconfig
```



You will need to configure your Pi for WiFi by editing the `/etc/network/interfaces` file. See here for more 
info http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/setting-up-wifi-with-occidentalis

You can use the interfaces template in the root directory named `interfaces.lilbot` 

Plug in the wifi dongle


```
// Back up the file first
sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.bkp

sudo cp interfaces.lilybot /etc/network/interfaces

sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces

// After editing the file restart
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Change the file to read, where you enter your own ssid and password. 

```
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid "YOUR_SSID"
    wpa-psk "YOUR_PASSKEY"
```


After you edit the `interfaces` file, restart the wlan0 adapter. 
```
sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo ifup wlan0
```

If succesful you can check the RPi's IP address on your router or do a ifconfig. The IP address will have changed. 
You should now be able to ssh in over Wi-Fi. Note you may need to reboot before you can access the Internet.



----
